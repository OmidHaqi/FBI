 ForceBindIP forces any application to use a specific network interface or IP address
 for all network connections. Instead of letting programs choose which network adapter
 to use, this tool intercepts network calls and redirects them through your preferred
 interface.

  - Cross-Platform support (Linux/Windows)
  - IPv4 & IPv6 support
  - Interface binding by name or IP address
  - TCP and UDP socket binding
  - Real-time operation without app restart
  - Verbose logging for debugging
