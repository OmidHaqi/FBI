.TH FORCEBINDIP 1 "July 2025" "ForceBindIP 1.0.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
forcebindip \- force applications to use specific network interfaces or IP addresses
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B forcebindip
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fICOMMAND\fR [\fIARGS\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
ForceBindIP forces any application to use a specific network interface or IP address for all network connections. Instead of letting programs choose which network adapter to use, this tool intercepts network calls and redirects them through your preferred interface.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-4 " " \fIIP\fR
Use specific IPv4 address for all connections
.TP
.BR \-6 " " \fIIP\fR
Use specific IPv6 address for all connections
.TP
.BR \-i " " \fIINTERFACE\fR
Use specific network interface (eth0, wlo1, tun0, etc.)
.TP
.BR \-p " " \fIPORT\fR
Bind to specific port (Linux only)
.TP
.BR \-v
Enable verbose output showing connection details
.TP
.BR \-l
List all available network interfaces
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Show help message and exit

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
List available network interfaces:
.B forcebindip \-l

.TP
Force curl to use specific IP address:
.B forcebindip \-4 192.168.1.100 curl http://httpbin.org/ip

.TP
Force Firefox through VPN interface:
.B forcebindip \-i tun0 firefox

.TP
Force SSH through ethernet with verbose output:
.B forcebindip \-v \-i eth0 ssh user@server.com

.TP
Test IPv4 binding with sample program:
.B forcebindip \-v \-4 192.168.1.3 test_ipv4

.SH USE CASES
.TP
.B VPN Routing
Force specific applications through VPN while others use regular connection
.TP
.B Multi-Network Setup
Choose which network adapter applications should use (WiFi, Ethernet, etc.)
.TP
.B Testing
Test applications with different network configurations
.TP
.B Security
Ensure sensitive applications only use secure network interfaces
.TP
.B Bandwidth Management
Route heavy downloads through specific connections

.SH HOW IT WORKS
ForceBindIP uses the LD_PRELOAD technique to intercept socket system calls. When an application creates a socket, ForceBindIP binds it to your chosen interface or IP address. All network traffic from that application then goes through the specified path.

The tool intercepts these socket functions:
.BR socket() ", " bind() ", " connect() ", " sendto() ", " getsockname()

.SH SUPPORTED APPLICATIONS
The tool works with any dynamically linked application that uses standard socket functions:
.br
• Web browsers: Firefox, Chrome
.br
• Command-line tools: curl, wget, ssh, nc, dig
.br
• Network utilities: ping, traceroute, nmap
.br
• Custom applications using standard socket APIs

.SH TROUBLESHOOTING
.TP
.B "Invalid argument" error
Don't use loopback addresses (127.0.0.1) for external connections. Use actual interface IP addresses instead.
.TP
.B Permission denied
Some applications may require elevated privileges. Try running with sudo.
.TP
.B Library not found
Ensure libforcebindip.so exists and is accessible. Rebuild if necessary.
