# ForceBindIP Version 2

ForceBindIP Version 2 is a tool that allows you to force applications to use a specific network interface by binding their sockets to a particular IP address or by specifying an interface GUID. Built as a rewrite of the original [ForceBindIP](https://r1ch.net/projects/forcebindip) in C++ using the MinHook library, it is useful for testing network configurations, ensuring applications use a specific network path, or bypassing certain network restrictions.

## Features

- Bind applications to a specific IPv4 or IPv6 address.

- Bind applications to a network interface using its GUID, automatically selecting the appropriate IP address based on the socket family.

- Supports both TCP and UDP sockets.

- Verbose mode for detailed logging and debugging.

## Requirements

- Windows operating system with Winsock support.

- Compiled with Visual Studio 2022.

- Requires the MinHook library for hooking Winsock functions.

## Usage

Run the injector with the following syntax:

```cmd
injector.exe [options] <program> [args...]
```

### Options

- `-v`: Enable verbose mode for detailed logging.

- `-4 <IPv4>`: Bind to the specified IPv4 address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).

- `-6 <IPv6>`: Bind to the specified IPv6 address (e.g., `fdfe:dcba:9876::1`).

- `-i <GUID>`: Bind to the network interface with the specified GUID (without curly braces, e.g., `11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555`).

### Notes on Binding

- **Direct IP Binding (`-4` or `-6`)**: The application’s sockets are bound to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address.

- **Interface Binding (`-i`)**: The injector resolves the GUID to an IP address, prioritizing non-link-local IPv6 over IPv4. The DLL then binds sockets to this IP, but the application must support the corresponding address family (e.g., `AF_INET` for IPv4, `AF_INET6` for IPv6).

- The application must create sockets compatible with the specified or resolved IP’s address family for binding to succeed.

## Examples

- **Bind to a specific IPv4 address:**

```cmd
injector.exe -4 192.168.1.1 program.exe
```

Output:

```cmd
DLL injected successfully with IPv4: 192.168.1.1
```

- **Bind to a specific IPv6 address:**

```cmd
injector.exe -6 fdfe:dcba:9876::1 program.exe
```

Output:

```cmd
DLL injected successfully with IPv6: fdfe:dcba:9876::1
```

- **Bind to a network interface using its GUID:**

```cmd
injector.exe -i 11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555 program.exe
```

Output (example with resolved IP):

```cmd
DLL injected successfully with interface IP: IPv6:fdfe:dcba:9876::1
```

- **Verbose mode with interface binding:**

```cmd
injector.exe -v -i 11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555 program.exe
```

To find your network interface GUIDs and their associated IP addresses, you can:

- Use `ipconfig /all` in the command prompt.

- ~~Build `guid.cpp` or run the provided `forcebindipguidfinder.exe` which lists active adapters.~~ use `-l` to get list of all working GUID and IPs

## Known Issues

- When using IPv4 binding (`-4`), some applications like `curl` may encounter errors such as:

```cmd
curl: (6) getaddrinfo() thread failed to start
```

- If the application’s socket family (e.g., `AF_INET`) does not match the resolved IP’s family (e.g., IPv6 from `-i`), binding may fail silently, and the application will use the default interface.

Report additional issues through the issue tracker.

## Notes

- Ensure the specified IP address or interface is available and properly configured on your system.

- When using `-i`, provide the GUID without curly braces (e.g., `11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555`).

- The tool hooks Winsock functions (`socket`, `bind`, `connect`, `sendto`, `getsockname`) to enforce binding.

- Please report any issues or success stories through the issue tracker.
